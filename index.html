    <p>For today's prep, I choose the valentine penguin ocal's grade to present the histograms. I used excel to generate 2 grade frequency graph below. I first record the data by reading the classData.json file to locate he's homework and quizzes grades. Then rearrange the data with frequency for the specific grade he got. I had two columns of data, one is the grade, another one is the corresponding frequency. And I selected the columns to insert bar charts which are shown below.
